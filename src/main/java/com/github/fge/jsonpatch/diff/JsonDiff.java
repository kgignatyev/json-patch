/**
 * "Reverse" factorizing JSON Patch implementation
 *
 * <p>This class only has one method, {@link #asJson(JsonNode, JsonNode)}, which
 * takes two JSON values as arguments and returns a patch as a {@link JsonNode}.
 * This generated patch can then be used in {@link
 * JsonPatch#fromJson(JsonNode)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Numeric equivalence is respected. Operations are always generated in the
 * following order:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>additions,</li>
 *     <li>removals,</li>
 *     <li>replacements.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Array values generate operations in the order of elements. Factorizing is
 * done to merge add and remove into move operations and convert duplicate add
 * to copy operations if values are equivalent. No test operations are
 * generated (they don't really make sense for diffs anyway).</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that due to the way {@link JsonNode} is implemented, this class is
 * inherently <b>not</b> thread safe (since {@code JsonNode} is mutable). It is
 * therefore the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the calling context
 * is safe (by ensuring, for instance, that only the diff operation has
 * references to the values to be diff'ed).</p>
